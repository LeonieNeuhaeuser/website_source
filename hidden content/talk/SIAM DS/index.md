# summary: No higher-order effects without non-linearity.
abstract: "This talk was given at the at the SIAM Conference on Applications of Dynamical Systems (DS21), specifically at the Minisymposium on Dynamical Processes on Networks with Higher-Order Interactions, organised by Federico Battiston, Christian Bick, Tobias BÃ¶hle, Juan G. Restrepo and
Jean-Gabriel Young. The talk is about our work on consensus dynamics on hypergraphs, particularly on the effects of non-linearity which is essential for revealing higher-order dynamical effects. "

title: CoRisk Index
summary: While the coronavirus spreads around the world, governments are attempting to reduce contagion rates at the expense of negative economic effects. To achieve higher effectiveness with cyclical and fiscal policy measures, it is key to identify the industries that are suffering the most from the unfolding economic crisis. We introduce the CoRisk-Index. It is the first economic indicator of industry-specific risk assessments related to Covid-19.

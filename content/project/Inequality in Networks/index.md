title: Inequality in Networks
summary: In many network settings, nodes can be grouped based on heterogeneous characteristics. For example, individuals in social networks differ on certain characteristics such as gender. Group membership can also affect how nodes form connections and thus the network structure, for example through tie formation mechanisms such as homophily. We model the effect of group membership on the documentation and formation of network structure. This allows us to gain a deeper understanding of issues such as inequality and marginalisation through the lens of network analysis.tags:

I am a doctoral researcher in the Computational Network Sciences Group at RWTH Aachen University, where I study the structure and dynamics of complex systems using methods from network science, mathematical modelling and graph learning. In particular, my research topics range from the study of dynamical systems on hypergraphs to investigating inequality and marginalisation through the lens of network analysis. During my PhD, I spent a year in the Governance Programme at the Hertie School Berlin, focusing on data science for public policy and natural language processing and was a visiting researcher at the Social Complexity Lab in Copenhagen.

I am the Social Secretary of the Women in Network Science Society and founding member of Women in AI Aachen. Reach out to me if you want to participate in events, want to know more about the societies or have any other suggestions or requests!

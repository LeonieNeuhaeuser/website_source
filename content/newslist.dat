**[04/05/23]** Our paper on [network interventions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-023-01218-9) was recently highlighted in Nature Reviews Physics. The highlight was part of a [group of 6 highlights](https://www.nature.com/natrevphys/volumes/5/issues/8) published on network science, celebrating 25 years since the Wattsâ€“Strogatz paper. Check it out [here](https://rdcu.be/diJMs)!
**[06/06/23]** New [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01813) out! In "Learning the effective order of a hypergraph dynamical system" we introduce a method to learn whether we need more than pairwise interactions to represent the underlying structure of a dynamical system.
**[23/05/23]** Our [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-023-01218-9) on network growth interventions was published in Communications Physics!
**[05/08/22]** [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03263.pdf) alert! In our paper "Improving the visibility of minorities through network growth interventions" we find that group size and behavioural interventions need to be coordinated to benefit the ranking position of minorities.
**[15/12/21]** Our [paper](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.104.064305) on consensus dynamics on temporal hypergraphs has now been published in Physical Review E!
**[23/09/21]** Now published in Applied Network Science: Our [paper](https://rdcu.be/cAHa3) on simulating systematic bias in attributed networks. Check it out!
**[23/09/21]** I gave a talk at [NetGCoop 2021](https://project.inria.fr/netgcoop2020/) (originally NetGCoop 2020) on our conference paper on [Opinion dynamics with Multi-Body Interactions](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-87473-5_23#citeas)
**[13/09/21]** New [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04985.pdf) out: It was a pleasure to work on consensus dynamics on temporal hypergraphs with Renaud Lambiotte and Michael Schaub. Check it out!
**[19/08/21]** My advisor Michael Schaub and I have been interviewed for an article in [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-big-data-carried-graph-theory-into-new-dimensions-20210819/) on higher-order networks. 
**[02/07/21]** I am co-organising this year's [HONS satellite](https://hons-web.github.io/online/program.html) at [Networks 2021](https://networks2021.net/) which will focus on Higher-order models in Social Systems. Join us for a great line-up of speakers on July 2nd!
**[31/06/21-01/07/21]** Join us for the first-ever [Women in Network Science (WiNS) Satellite](http://tinyurl.com/WiNSSatellite) happening as part of [Networks 2021](https://networks2021.net/).
